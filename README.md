#  Archane Games
VR technology is advancing rapidly and it should be widely introduced to the public. Since we are currently living in the 21st century pandemic,with vr technology you can have the immersive experience for places that you are not able to visit. This platform provides a variety of games catered for different users base on their own likings. 

## Design Process
This is a website that promotes virtual reality through the use of games and immersive technology. Users can purchase the latest VR entertainment and upcomming games that will be released on this platform.

Users can login daily to claim shards, which can be used to get discounts off their purchased items. 
Alternatively, they can participate in the "Spin the disc" event once a day to claim bonus shards. They can also refer this site to a friend and get 200 shards in return.

* As a customer, I want to collect shards so I can purchase the virtual reality games at a discounted price.
* As a customer, I want to find out more about the upcomming virtual reality games that are available.
* As a user, I want to purchase the latest virtual reality games at a discounted price.
* As a user, I want to purchase discounted virtual reality games.
* As a site owner, I want to sell as many virtual reality games as possible.
