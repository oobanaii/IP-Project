	  <p id="gameDescrip">Two lightsabers, slashing to music. Beat Saber is a music-rhythm movement/dance game that's done so well, it's already in arcades. Slash blocks in particular directions, avoid bombs, duck obstacles, and suddenly it's a workout. A really, really great rave-dance VR lightsaber workout.</p>

	  <p id="gameDescrip">It's been available for a while, but there might not be a funnier/weirder game than this perfect VR version of Rick and Morty. It has all the feel of Job Simulator, but infused with even more brilliant transformations of a the surrounding environment. It's like an episode come to life in your face.</p>

	  <p id="gameDescrip">This is still one of the first games I download to show new-to-VR players what's possible. The original desktop version was fun to walk around in and putt across a seemingly endless run of courses, but the mobile version packs in nearly the same experience, minus the walking.</p>

	  <p id="gameDescrip">Imagine peeking into a tiny dollhouse world where a fairy tale mouse hops around to save the world and solve puzzles. Moss puts the player in the position of helpful spirit, guiding a little mouse hero on a massive journey through a little magic kingdom. Each level feels like a living miniature, and the illusion of being close to a tiny, living world is perfect. This is a beautiful game.</p>

	  <p id="gameDescrip">Even if you don't have a PSVR, Sony's excellent Wipeout compilation makes for a great play on PS4. The VR modes are thrown in as a bonus, and happen to be some of the best racing experiences in VR you can have right now.</p>

	  <p id="gameDescrip">Much like Farpoint, Firewall Zero Hour is made to take advantage of Sony's excellent PSVR Aim rifle controller. The online play, the arcade-like but stressful missions...if you've wanted an online squad-based VR shooter, and you have a PSVR, this is the game to play at the moment.</p>

	  <p id="gameDescrip">Settlers of Catan is one of the best board games ever made. This VR adaptation captures the physical board-game table feel remarkably well, and even pops avatars around the table in online play. It's a really good fit for Oculus Go, where the simplified controls and mobile headset help make it easier to dive in.</p>

	  <p id="gameDescrip">Named after the real-life cognitive phenomenon and designed by Tetsuya Mizuguchi, the creator of Rez Infinite and the classic Lumines, this is Tetris... in VR... and it's incredible. Music and visuals sync with your moves to create synaesthetic, hypnotic flow gaming. You can play the game on PS4 without VR, but it's even better with the headset on.</p>

	  <p id="gameDescrip">There are many ways to play Skyrim, but experiencing it all in VR is more entertaining than you might think. The entire game's here, but now you can look around to take in the epic views, or use your hands to strike out or cast spells. One of the better ports of a game into VR, and it can be played seated, too.</p>

	  <p id="gameDescrip">If you ever wondered what a party game in VR would look like, Werewolves Within is still a classic example. Knowing who to trust and who's lying makes for a simple and really effective experience. It's surprising that more games like this don't exist in VR.</p>

	  <p id="gameDescrip">Sony's miraculous Mario-like platforming game isn't just one of the best VR games...it's one of the best games, period. Big, bright worlds and charming, hyper-real animated creatures surround you as you dive into a series of platforming challenges to rescue lost robot buddies. The level designs, puzzles, and clever tools that seem to sprout from your PlayStation controller are inspired. It's as close to "Nintendo in VR" as we're likely to get (even if it's not made by Nintendo).</p>

	  <p id="gameDescrip">If I could only have a single VR game, Fallout 4 would be the one. It's not without its flaws -- we're talking about a still-buggy overhaul of a two-year old game that was never designed for VR. But being able to fully immerse myself in Bethesda's post-apocalyptic wasteland with a virtual Pip-Boy strapped to my actual wrist is an absolute joy. I didn't even notice it was 2AM until the hours had already flown by. Plus, it's one of the very few full-length, open-world games in VR -- which means a big enough world you could literally play for weeks on end.</p>

	  <p id="gameDescrip">You're on the highway to Hell, banging your head to the beat. Your steed is a silver beetle traveling at the speed of sound, on a collision course with the devil himself. He's throwing every obstacle in your path, bending the fabric of space itself to stop your deadly charge. Press buttons, to the beat, to dodge his traps and destroy him.</p>

	  <p id="gameDescrip">My human body is gone, but I don't even care. Instead of flesh, bone and sinew, my hands are made of titanium -- I can even see the mechanical tendons flex when I bend a finger. They've got built-in thrusters and plasma cutters, which is handy because I'm in zero-G, trying to repair a space station. This is Lone Echo, and it's probably my second favorite game in VR. It perfectly embraces VR's strengths and limitations with its zero-G movement, where you have to literally grab onto parts of the station to pull yourself forward. Reaching out to interact with objects is eerie, but natural, and production values are top-notch. It's a VR world that feels convincing because it feels lived in. And that's without mentioning the multiplayer mode, Echo Arena -- it's like the Battle Room from Ender's Game, only with a disc instead of guns.</p>

	  <p id="gameDescrip">Zen is the opposite of Eve: Valkyrie. It's a frantic space dogfight where the only moments of peace are when your cockpit shatters and your body freezes in the inky blackness of space. But if you've ever wanted to pilot a starfighter, it feels like a dream come true. I still get chills being catapulted out of the launch tube. Plus, you can play six-on-six matches with your friends who own headsets on different VR platforms now. Here's hoping for a decent single-player mode.</p>

	  <p id="gameDescrip">You've probably never played anything like The Invisible Hours. It's not a game in the traditional sense where you choose what to do -- instead, this vintage murder mystery is all about being in the right place in the right time to observe seven suspects who may have murdered the famous scientist Nikola Tesla in his secluded mansion. You can't be everywhere at once -- but by rewinding and fast forwarding time from literally anywhere in the mansion you'd like, you can slowly piece together the clues. VR adds a real sense of presence: You're a fly on the wall as the events of the evening transpire.</p>

	  <p id="gameDescrip">Yes. Believe it or not, Fruit Ninja makes for a brilliant VR game. With a pair of motion controllers, swinging a Japanese katana to slice and stab scores of juicy, helpless fruit is a real treat. It's peaceful, relaxing and violent all at the same time. </p>

	  <p id="gameDescrip">When I put people into VR for the very first time, Space Pirate Trainer is one of my go-to titles. It's a highly addictive game where you shoot waves of flying robots with twin laser pistols that transform into shotguns, grenade launches and gauss rifles at the push of a button, while using your actual body to dodge enemy laser beams. Oh, and you can pull out a reflective shield or energy whip. </p>

	  <p id="gameDescrip">Pavlov VR, too, is an unfinished team-based shooter where you have to realistically reload your weapons and aim. But where Onward is hyper-focused on realistic 5 vs. 5 military simulation, Pavlov isn't afraid to get a bit zany. While the basic game is a riff on Counter-Strike (you buy weapons each round with money you earn, go defuse bombs and things like that), I also joined servers that threw me into hilarious non-stop deathmatches and even custom maps. GoldenEye 007 in VR? Yes please.</p>

	  <p id=" gameDescrip">Can VR be good exercise? Absolutely. Audioshield, from the creator of Audiosurf, is like Guitar Hero meets Tae Bo. You literally punch your way through incoming beats of music -- any music of your choice. (What's on your hard drive?) We'd recommend something thumpin' for the best workout. Beat Saber has overtaken Audioshield since its release, but it's still worth playing.</p>

	  <p id="gameDescrip">There's no describing the majesty that is Rez Infinite. 16 years ago, the original Rez was already a musical mind trip on old-school 2D TVs. Now, the Tron-like environments are all around you. It's like flying through neon code</p>

	  <p id="gameDescrip">One of the other few AAA, big-budget video games you can play entirely in VR, Resident Evil 7 doesn't disappoint. Despite losing a lot of graphical fidelity when you plug in a VR headset, the game is almost too atmospheric, too scary, because the horror is all around you. You literally can't look away.Just know you may need a strong stomach as well -- while the game is much improved since its E3 demo, it still made me a bit queasy.</p>

	  <p id="gameDescrip">Immersive, frenetic and tough as nails, Battlezone isn't just a remake of the old-school arcade shooting game. There's strategy, too, as you pick your path through procedurally generated campaign maps, save up credits for more powerful weapons and coordinate hover tank assaults with up to three friends in online co-op multiplayer. What you can't see in this picture: VR gives you awesome peripheral vision to let you pick off targets instead of getting blindsided.</p>

	  <p id="gameDescrip">With or without VR, Superhot has a brilliant conceit: Time only moves when you move. Which means you can be utterly surrounded by enemies bristling with machine guns or ones ready to slice you into pieces, and still defeat them all by -- oh so slowly -- brushing their weapons aside, dodging bullets, throwing pots and pans, etc. Every level plays like a puzzle as much as a shooter, and you come out looking like an action hero every time.</p>

	  <p id="gameDescrip">You're a gladiator in the arena, and it's time to bash in some skulls -- with a zany array of seemingly spring-loaded weapons you actually swing with your own two hands. Gorn is a bloody mess in more ways than one (it's a Steam Early Access title that's still rough around the edges), but it's definitely fun... and far enough along I can actually recommend it now. The new local multiplayer mode (your friends can control the enemy gladiators by firing up an Xbox gamepad) is an added bonus. Just don't break your TV when you're swinging those controllers around.</p>

	  <p id="gameDescrip">The second must-play game about shooting waves of enemy robots, Robo Recall is fantastic fun. You're a bit like Neo in The Matrix -- you'll teleport into a group of robots, slow down time, pick their bullets out of the air and throw them back. You can also juggle robots with blasts from your own twin pistols, grab their weapons away and even rip off their limbs then beat baddies down with 'em. It's not a very deep or long game, but figuring out ways to increasingly stylishly dispatch your foes and compete for high scores keeps me coming back. Plus, Epic's opened up the game to modders. Fans have already added a lightsaber.</p>

	  <p id="gameDescrip">It's the Wii Sports of VR, and my colleague Dan Ackerman says it's the most fun he's had yet.

Even just juggling in front of peers is amusing, but the teleportation-filled paintball game is the real entree. </p>

	  <p id="gameDescrip">Not all VR games need to teleport you to a jaw-droppingly immersive all-around-you space. Instead, Witchblood draws its inspiration from classics like Castlevania and Prince of Persia for its side-scrolling adventure. Your young witch hops from platform to platform, collecting the necessary spells she needs to reach the next area and defeat her foes. The VR just lends a neat diorama-like feel to the art, and makes it that much easier to time her jumps.</p>

	  <p id="gameDescrip">You're an eagle, flying through an artistic recreation of Paris in a gigantic aerial game of capture-the-flag -- only the flag is a rabbit that you're fighting over with other groups of eagles as you swoop and soar at incredible speed.

	  <p id="gameDescrip">One of the very best VR games only requires one person to wear a headset. In Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes, one player is in a tiny room, faced with a fiendish bomb to defuse. Everyone else has the hilariously complex bomb defusal manual, and both sides have to describe the bomb, and the instructions, before it explodes. A perfect party game.</p>

	  <p id="gameDescrip">The Unspoken describes itself as "an urban magic fight club," and that sounds about right: you pick one of five different wizard archetypes (the Electromancer was just introduced this June) and fling spells, erect shields and hammer down with deadly ancient artifacts in one-on-one player vs. player duels.</p>

	  <p id="gameDescrip">You don't have to own a powerful PC-based VR rig to fling spells, though: Wands does it just as well (but a little bit different) on a Gear VR or Daydream-ready phone. While the graphics aren't as flashy, they're quite nice for a mobile title, and the game's a bit more tactical: Victory is more about choosing the right combination of spells to trap your opponent than about aiming them well.</p>

	  <p id="gameDescrip">Speaking of excellent multiplayer VR games where it's tough to find an online match, Dead and Buried is very high on my list. It's a Wild West showdown with all the trimmings, with revolvers, shotguns, lever-action rifles, dynamite and more in two-on-two saloon shootouts, train robberies and straight-up quick-draw duels.</p>

	  <p id="gameDescrip">There really aren't enough games to justify Google's Daydream headset for games alone -- but Eclipse: Edge of Light is a must if you buy one anyhow.

	  <p id="gameDescrip">If you buy a PlayStation VR, you must try Until Dawn: Rush of Blood. It's a truly scary horror game mixed with a pitch-perfect shooting gallery. You ride a slow-moving roller coaster that takes an unplanned turn into a haunted house, where all manner of sinister things await -- things you might only see when your gun-mounted flashlights are pointed at them. Seven solid levels, hidden secrets, advanced difficulty levels and online leaderboards give it loads of replay value.</p>

	  <p id="gameDescrip">Much like Fruit Ninja, Smash Hit is a relaxing, cathartic game about breaking things that's even better in VR -- partly because you feel like you're more directly engaged, and partly because you can be extra zen when you're isolated from the world. Here, you're breaking glass with steel marbles instead of slicing fruit. If you don't have a headset, try the regular app for free on iOS or Android, then just imagine it in 3D, all around you.</p>

	  <p id="gameDescrip">The Climb skews close to a one-off VR experience, because -- while totally awesome -- the initial sensation of "Oh my god, look how high up I am" doesn't last. But climbing up the side of a mount is still a fun, relaxing way to spend some time in a virtual paradise.</p>

While the plot's pretty silly and you're generally just fighting wave after wave of dumb robots, the wow factor is in the immediacy of your controls -- those skeleton pistols can feel like they're really in your hand, and you have to actually swing that sword -- waggling isn't enough. Plus, you can team up with a buddy in online co-op.</p>

	  <img src="https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/64030a710e970314afcca29a163b0f6342a840d2/hub/2016/04/04/28073f37-7790-409f-8da4-e32ad35e5705/14-job-simulator.jpg?auto=webp&width=1092" alt="Job Simulator" id="gamepic">
	  <p id="gameDescrip">In a world where robots have taken all the jobs, there are no consequences for failure. That's why Job Simulator is so hilarious. Pick an office drone, auto repair worker, short-order cook or convenience store clerk, then "fulfill" an increasingly complex set of orders with clever combinations of the tools and ingredients around you. Or just grab things and throw them.</p>

	  <h4 id="gameTitle">Darknet</h4>
	  <img src="https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/aa0753d211d613cfe82fdb779d7826b07fa6e14b/hub/2016/03/27/2328bf69-cbb5-4d8d-873f-2378cd65b870/darknetscreenshot3.png?auto=webp&width=1092" alt="Darknet" id="gamepic">
	  <p id="gameDescrip">It's the cyberpunk hacking game you've wanted since you first read Neuromancer. Each network in Darknet is a puzzle, where you need to infect the right nodes to gain control -- and thus earn credits from your efforts to buy the tools you need to own even more of the grid.</p>

	  <h4 id="gameTitle">Virtual Virtual Reality</h4>
	  <img src="https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/e39090565ec6c8e5b503f09804880d67492d7701/hub/2017/07/14/964bb212-7e7c-49e5-92ff-eb8e68ae6a44/virtual-virtual-reality-2.jpg?auto=webp&width=1092" alt="Virtual Virtual Reality" id="gamepic">
	  <p id="gameDescrip">Virtual Virtual Reality is a real trip. You're a human performing jobs in virtual reality in a future where artificial intelligence rule the world and see human labor as artisinal -- jobs like sticking pieces of toast to a giant intelligent stick of butter. And then the cracks in reality start to appear.</p>

	  <h4 id="gameTitle">Fantastic Contraption</h4>
	  <img src="https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/cc3b9065d76d8656ac4a19f7c62be7764679d0ef/hub/2016/03/28/8f83f906-762b-4bb0-904d-f376f5f7fade/fantastic-contraption-test.png?auto=webp&width=1092" alt="Fantastic Contraption" id="gamepic">
	  <p id="gameDescrip">In Fantastic Contraption you build zany machines with your own two hands by stretching objects and connecting them together, with wheels, conveyors and other moving parts. Send them to complete objectives on the other side of the island, so you can teleport to the next one.</p>

	  <h4 id="gameTitle">Damaged Core</h4>
	  <img src="https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/201bc3ce1c384458cf50fdbbb2bfbd96c54c0045/hub/2017/07/14/40237c09-c061-4747-9cc1-0c405016d5b1/damaged-core.jpg?auto=webp&width=1092" alt="Damaged Core" id="gamepic">
	  <p id="gameDescrip">One of the first VR titles to let you traverse a world without walking or unrealistically warping around, Damaged Core sees you play an artificial intelligence that can possess robots and wireless cameras. Teleport into a enemy robot and use its telescopic sight and deadly laser rifle to pick off your foes, then just warp into a new one when your host is about to expire.</p>

	  <h4 id="gameTitle">Drop Dead</h4>
	  <img src="https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/6cb0be6b492cdeff98fe7512481611835973ed22/hub/2017/07/14/2a3487ab-74ff-4853-a83c-8e36dd043a62/drop-dead-gear-vr.jpg?auto=webp&width=1092" alt="Drop Dead"id="gamepic">
	  <p id="gameDescrip">Yep, it's another game where you're shooting at wave after wave of enemies -- but Drop Dead has an actual plot (stopping a mad scientist by traveling through time), characters, decent voice acting and particularly impressive graphics for a Gear VR mobile title. </p>
